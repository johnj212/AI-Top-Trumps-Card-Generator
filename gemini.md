# Gemini API Project Reference: Top Trumps Card Generator

This document outlines the usage of the Google Gemini API for the Top Trumps Card Generator project.

## 1. Core Services

The application leverages the `@google/genai` SDK for two primary AI-driven tasks:
1.  **Text Generation (`gemini-2.5-flash`):** Used for creating thematic content for the cards.
2.  **Image Generation (`imagen-3.0-generate-002`):** Used for generating the main artwork for each card.

## 2. Text Generation (`gemini-2.5-flash`)

### a. Generating Thematic Statistics

-   **Purpose:** When a user selects a theme (e.g., "Dinosaurs"), the app calls Gemini to generate a list of 6 relevant statistics.
-   **Model:** `gemini-2.5-flash`
-   **Configuration:**
    -   `responseMimeType`: "application/json"
    -   `responseSchema`: An array of objects, where each object has a `name` (string) and a default `value` (integer).
-   **Example Prompt:** "Based on the theme 'Fantasy', generate exactly 6 thematically appropriate statistic names for a Top Trumps style trading card game. Examples for 'Dinosaurs' could be 'Height', 'Weight', 'Deadliness', 'Speed'."

### b. Generating Full Card Packs

-   **Purpose:** After the user finalizes the theme and style, this service generates the content for a pack of 4 unique cards.
-   **Model:** `gemini-2.5-flash`
-   **Configuration:**
    -   `responseMimeType`: "application/json"
    -   `responseSchema`: An array of 4 card objects. Each object contains:
        -   `title`: string (e.g., "Armored Land Dragon")
        -   `stats`: An array of 6 statistic objects (`name`: string, `value`: integer from 1-100).
        -   `imagePrompt`: A detailed, visually rich string for the image generation model.
-   **Example Prompt:** "You are a creative assistant for a Top Trumps card game. The game's series is called 'Mythical Creatures'. Based on the theme of 'Fantasy', generate 4 unique and creative card concepts. For each card, provide a compelling title and assign balanced, thematic values between 1 and 100 for the statistics: 'Magic Power', 'Strength', 'Agility', 'Wisdom', 'Fear Factor', 'Defense'. The values should be plausible for the card's title. Also, create a detailed, visually rich prompt for an AI image generator to create an image for this card in a 'Holographic foil effect art' style."

## 3. Image Generation (`imagen-3.0-generate-002`)

-   **Purpose:** To create the main visual for each card based on the prompt generated in the previous step.
-   **Model:** `imagen-3.0-generate-002`
-   **Configuration:**
    -   `numberOfImages`: 1
    -   `outputMimeType`: 'image/jpeg' (or 'image/png')
    -   `aspectRatio`: '9:16' to best fit the tall, portrait orientation of the card.
-   **Input:** The `imagePrompt` string generated by `gemini-2.5-flash`.
-   **Output:** A base64 encoded string of the generated image, which is then embedded into the card component using a data URI (`data:image/jpeg;base64,...`).
