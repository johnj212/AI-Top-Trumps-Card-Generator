prompt: `You are a creative assistant for a Top Trumps card game. The game's series is called "Pokémon". Based on the theme of "Pokémon", generate 1 unique and creative card concept. For each card, provide a compelling title and assign balanced, thematic values between 1 and 100 for the following statistics: Health Points, Physical Attack, Physical Defense, Speed, Elemental Attack, Elemental Defense. The values should be plausible for the card's title. Also, create a detailed, visually rich prompt for an AI image generator to create an image for this card in a "Neon Cyberpunk" style. Crucially, the image must feature ONLY the single subject from the card's title, isolated or in a simple environment, without other creatures or characters. The prompt should be creative and describe a dynamic scene focusing on that single subject. \n`

Gemini Image Generation

Prompt: `A majestic, ethereal Datawyrm Streamer, resembling a sleek, serpentine dragon formed entirely from glowing neon circuit lines and cascading digital data particles. It bursts forth from a shimmering, fragmented data portal, its body coiling and twisting dynamically mid-air, leaving intricate trails of electric blue, vibrant pink, and pulsing green light. Its head, sharp and angular with intense, glowing cybernetic eyes, is framed by a mane of constantly shifting, holographic data streams. The creature's 'scales' are intricate, self-illuminating patterns of microchips, fiber optics, and binary code. In the blurred, deep-focus background, a dark, rain-slicked cyberpunk cityscape with towering, neon-lit skyscrapers creates a sense of immense depth, but the sharp focus remains entirely on the Datawyrm, isolated and powerful in the foreground. The atmospheric air is thick with digital interference, wisps of steam, and a faint holographic haze, emphasizing its digital nature. Cinematic lighting, deep shadows contrasting with intense neon highlights, volumetric light, ultra-detailed, high resolution, vaporwave aesthetic, 8K.`
